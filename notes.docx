Objects
In programming, an object is a structure of code that models a real-life object. You can have a simple object that represents a box and contains information about its width, length, and height, or you could have an object that represents a person, and contains data about their name, height, weight, what language they speak, how to say hello to them, and more.

let dog = { name : 'Spot', breed : 'Dalmatian' };
dog.name
dog.breed
